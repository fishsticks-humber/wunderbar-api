Tips and tricks to work with database:
all files we need to look into are in database folder

1) Commands:
php artisan migrate - run ALL migrations, no other option sadly
php artisan db:seed --class=<Name of the class> (example BoardsTableSeeder)

2) Recommendations to creating and populating db:
 - Run migrations in such order, because there are adjustments that I have done which don't allow to do it in any order :
 1) Create users table
 2) Create restaurants table
 3) Create Reviews Table
 4) Create Boards Table
 5) for last two doesn't matter

 IMPORTANT: how to run needed migrations - you send migrations that you don't need to other project folder, for example - factories, when
 you have only one migration you call in console - php artisan migrate

 About seeders, I guess you can just call php artisan db:seed  it will run DatabaseSeeder class to run all seeders at once,
 so it will work fine, but do it only after you migrate all tables.
